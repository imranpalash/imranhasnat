I am a media studies scholar and educator specializing in digital communication, public diplomacy, and international media relations. Currently serving as a Senior Lecturer of Media Studies at Chengdu University in China, my academic journey bridges East and West, combining rigorous research with innovative teaching approaches in digital media and international communication.

My research explores the intersection of social media, public diplomacy, and international relations, with a particular focus on how digital platforms transform diplomatic engagement and national image-building. My doctoral dissertation at the University of Oklahoma examined how foreign embassies in the United States leverage social media for public diplomacy, while my earlier work investigated the role of tourism advertising in reshaping national narratives, specifically Bangladesh's journey from being perceived as a "bottomless basket" to "Beautiful Bangladesh."

As an educator, I have taught across various institutions including the University of Oklahoma, University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh, and now Chengdu University. My teaching portfolio spans digital storytelling, multimedia journalism, research methodology, and media ethics. I am particularly passionate about empowering students with digital skills and critical thinking abilities essential for navigating today's complex media landscape.

My scholarly work has appeared in respected journals including Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, and I have contributed to books published by Routledge and Peter Lang. Beyond traditional academic work, I have developed award-winning digital projects like "Race to Refuge," an interactive narrative that simulates the refugee vetting process, demonstrating my commitment to using digital storytelling for social impact.

With experience spanning multiple continents and cultures, I bring a global perspective to both research and teaching. My background in international relations, combined with expertise in digital media and communication, allows me to bridge theoretical frameworks with practical applications in today's interconnected world. Whether analyzing diplomatic communication strategies or teaching students to create compelling digital narratives, I remain committed to understanding and teaching how media shapes our global understanding and connections.

I am particularly interested in research collaborations and educational initiatives that explore how digital media can foster international understanding and effective cross-cultural communication. My work continues to evolve with the changing media landscape, always focusing on how we can better understand and utilize digital platforms for meaningful communication and social impact.
